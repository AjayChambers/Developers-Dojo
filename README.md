# DEVELOPER'S DOJO

Developer's Dojo is a fully developed theme for VS Code. Its perfect for anyone writing typed languages such as TypeScript, C++, and Java. It's also a great choice for HTML, CSS, and Markdown.

### With so many themes available, why create another one?

Developer's Dojo is developed for specific languages rather than a generalized syntax highlighting scheme that's used for everything. Dev Dojo takes full advantage of the very powerful TextMate grammars that VS Code uses. VS Code targets deep inside these grammars for each individual language making Developer's Dojo the perfect choice if you are coding in any of its supported languages. Developer's Dojo also uses different syntax highlighting schemes for certain file types, such as configuration files, or .ignore files (i.e. .gitignore, .npmignore, ect...). VS Code has done a great job in ensuring its extension and theme developers have the very best tools for the job. We want to show our appreciation by taking full advantage of those tools, and deliver a theme that that offers syntax highlighting of a different caliber. When authored correctly, VS Code themes can highlight the syntax of most languages better than any other IDE or editor, and we aim to prove that.

  - C++
  - TypeScript
  - CSS
  - HTML
